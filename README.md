# Pacman101

Basic animation using javascript.


<h2>Description</h2>
Pacman 101 is an animation which consists of two animations going 
from left to right initially and then left to right. There are different ways to
create this. The approach used and encouraged in this exercise it's based on the use of 2D arrays for the
images which would later be used in one function named Run() to determine which images would go to the right 
side of the screen and which ones would go to the left.

The function Run wouldlater call another function CheckPageBounds() which helps "pacman" to head back to the left direction
once it hits the pageWidth, and then once the position of pacman hits 0 on the X axis this functions allows to bounce to the right
using if statements.

<h2>Installation</h2>

You would only have to download all the images and html file to fire it up on your screen.
Once you download them you can open them in your browser 
to see yellow packman going to the left and right of your screen. 

<h2>Usage</h2>

Feel free to open the html file along with the images in the IDE of your choice where you could do the following things:

+ Change the animations by editing the img.src
+ Edit the setInterval to make it go slower or faster
+ Add more pacmans to the screen which would allow you to keep practicing loops/if statements
+ Practice more if and for loops by making the direction more dynamic.
+ Or simply look at the beautiful yellow pacman go across your browser.

<h2>RoadMap</h2>

Perhaps, the goal would be to add more pacmans and make it more of laberynth pacman game that
eats avocados along the way to make it to the finish line.
